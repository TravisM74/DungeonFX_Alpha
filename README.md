# DungeonFX_Alpha
re write of the 1st attempt dungeonFX

this rewrite was enspired by the many new ways and ideas I have had on how to create the game.
currently the goal is to get it to the same level of development of the original developing verson 
but with much cleaner code, less bugs and more concise logic.

the changes in this rewite where so drastic from the original as can be seen in the same functionality from the much clener code.

features lootable wepons 
wearing gear
Combat
Waves of enemies
Enemies with random loot and weapons
Different weapons.
